 What are some project management strategies that require TDD?
 - Having team members working on different parts of the code


 Part 2

 Pseudocode 
 - for gpa: student name, student grades (integer), test to make sure the answer is between 0.7 and 4.0, test to make sure its an integer
 - edge cases: 
 	- if the result is a string, boolean, or array: bad path
 	- if the result is an integer: happy path
 - public properties: name
 - private properties: grades, gpa
 - constructor: name, grades

 How would you verify the GPA is correct?
